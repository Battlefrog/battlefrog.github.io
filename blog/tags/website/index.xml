      <description>When I first thought of the prospect of making my own company, I quickly realized that I needed to have some sort of online presence (read: website).
This idea was a little bit scary for me. I had no idea how to make a website, let alone host one. So, I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you how I did it, and also show you some problems I faced.
Step 1: Skipping most people&amp;rsquo;s Step 1 Okay, here&amp;rsquo;s the deal: I pretty much knew the basics of HTML and CSS, meaning I understood a lot more than other people starting out with Web Development.</description>

      <description>The blog now has a custom URL! This took some time to sort out (Mostly DNS related issues&amp;hellip; this Blogger instance is running on a DreamHost DNS, which is the main website is setup. Figuring that out was a little hard.) but finally I think it&amp;rsquo;s fine and the two websites should stay up.
I have moved development to a private Azure git instance, just so my commercial game isn&amp;rsquo;t on github to build and deploy.</description>
