      <description>After quite a while with radio silence (nearly two months&amp;hellip;) coming from Sledgehog Software, here comes this devlog. Hooray.
First of all, it was a fat break. Apparently, my mind thought it was too long after Godot 3.1 was announced so I started work on it recently. Here&amp;rsquo;s things I&amp;rsquo;ve changed, added, or deleted.
Balancing As more and more levels were added to Cubytes, a form of design debt came up with the older levels.</description>

      <description>The blog now has a custom URL! This took some time to sort out (Mostly DNS related issues&amp;hellip; this Blogger instance is running on a DreamHost DNS, which is the main website is setup. Figuring that out was a little hard.) but finally I think it&amp;rsquo;s fine and the two websites should stay up.
I have moved development to a private Azure git instance, just so my commercial game isn&amp;rsquo;t on github to build and deploy.</description>
